/* Original LinuxIGD used ip_nat_multi_range struct found from linux/netfilter_ipv4/ip_nat.h
 * For some reason that header file doesn't exist anymore and structs defined there were
 * moved to linux headers (.../include/net/netfilter/nf_nat.h). All worked well when that 
 * file was included from headers for kernel 2.6.24-22, but for 2.6.27-11 it didn't work anymore.
 * So basically I copied following three unions and structs from that older kernel-header file. 
 * Someone can do better solution by rewriting some code from iptc.c and here.
